### Introduction

**Wisdom Waves** is an innovative data visualization tool designed to simplify the analysis and presentation of data extracted from Excel and CSV files. Targeted at users needing an intuitive way to view and interact with data spreadsheets, Wisdom Waves provides a robust environment for opening, reviewing, and graphing complex datasets with ease.

#### Project Overview

Upon launching Wisdom Waves, users are greeted with an interface where they can quickly load existing data files through a conveniently placed sidebar or directly from the 'Recent' menu. The application supports a variety of data formats, including the most commonly used Excel and CSV file types.

Once a file is loaded, the application offers a tabular view of the contents, allowing users to select individual sheets to visualize. Each sheet's data is presented in a clear and editable format on the Home Page, which serves as the central hub for data interaction. While direct editing of data is supported within the table view, it is important to note that these changes are not currently reflected when graphs are generated, as the graphing functionality captures the state of data at the time of file loading.

#### Graphing Capabilities

Wisdom Waves excels in its graphing capabilities, which are accessible via the 'Graph' menu. Users can launch a dedicated graphing window that allows for the comparison of up to two different data sheets simultaneously.

The application's graphing interface is designed to be interactive and user-friendly. Checkboxes allow for dynamic selection and deselection of data sheets for comparison. Graphs are automatically updated to reflect current selections, ensuring that users have up-to-date visual data representation at their fingertips. Special attention is given to datasets with varying target values, with distinct markers and colors used to differentiate between them effectively. If no sheets are selected, the graph display is cleared, allowing users to start a new selection without clutter or residue from previous data views.

#### Purpose of the Test Plan

This Test Plan Document outlines the strategies, methodologies, and resources allocated for the comprehensive testing of Wisdom Waves. The purpose of testing is to ensure that all functionalities, from file loading and data display to advanced graphing capabilities, operate efficiently and accurately under various conditions. The plan includes detailed test cases designed to cover most features, ensuring that Wisdom Waves meets its design specifications and is robust against potential errors or user challenges.

### Approach

The testing approach for the Wisdom Waves application is designed to comprehensively evaluate the application's functionality, usability, and reliability. This section outlines the methods and techniques that will be employed to ensure that each feature meets its intended specifications and provides a high-quality user experience.

#### Testing Methodology

1. **Manual Testing** :

* **Interactive Use** : Testers will manually interact with the application to simulate typical user activities. This includes opening files, navigating through the application, using graphing features, and utilizing help resources.
* **Interface Testing** : Testers will verify that all UI components, such as buttons, dialogs, and menus, function as expected and are user-friendly.

1. **Functional Testing** :

* **Feature Verification** : Each core functionality, such as file opening, data display, and graph generation, will be tested to ensure it operates according to the requirements.
* **Error Handling** : Testers will input erroneous data or perform unsupported operations to ensure the application handles these gracefully without crashing.

1. **Regression Testing** :

* After any fixes or updates, regression tests will be conducted to ensure that previously working functionalities have not been broken by the new changes.

#### Testing Techniques

* **Boundary Value Analysis** :
* This technique will be applied, especially in graphing functionalities, where limits (like a maximum of two checkboxes) are set. Testers will check these boundaries to ensure they are enforced correctly.
* **Equivalence Partitioning** :
* Input data for testing will be divided into equivalent groups (such as different file types and graphable vs. non-graphable data) to reduce the total number of test cases while covering all scenarios.

#### Tools and Resources

* **Test Environment** :
* The application will be tested on both Windows and macOS to ensure cross-platform compatibility.
* Different versions of Excel and CSV files will be used to simulate real-world use cases.
* **Documentation** :
* Test cases will be documented, including expected outcomes and actual results.
* Screenshots and error logs will be captured for each test case to provide visual proof and detailed insights into any issues encountered.

#### Feedback and Iteration

* **Continuous Improvement** :
* Feedback from testing will be systematically recorded and reviewed with the development team.
* Adjustments and enhancements will be prioritized based on the severity and impact of the issues found.
* **Stakeholder Updates** :
* Regular updates will be provided to stakeholders to keep them informed about the testing progress and any significant findings.
